In LTR scripts, such as English, text flows from left to right, with the leftmost character being the starting point. In RTL scripts, such as Arabic or Hebrew, text flows from right to left, with the rightmost character as the starting point. The choice of LTR or RTL depends on the script used and the reading direction of the language."
